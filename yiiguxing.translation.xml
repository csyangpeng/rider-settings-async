      <item value="Git, SVN, Mercurial, and other VCS plugins provide the Annotate action that displays the last revision and user id for every line of the currently edited file, so you can easily see where this or that code came from. Sometimes this action takes a significant amount of time to run because the IDE has to load and process a lot of data from VCS. This plugin speeds this process up by preloading and caching the data required to run the Annotate action when you open a file. So if you're using the Annotate action often, the plugin is surely worth checking out." />
